<!-- BACKGROUND RESEARCH -->
<div class="section-break">
    <h2>BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h2>

    <h3>Description of Background Research Conducted</h3>

    <p>This survey instrument draws on established best practices in higher education faculty assessment, synthesizing validated items from leading national surveys. The primary research foundation includes the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey, widely considered the gold standard for faculty climate assessment with psychometric validation across hundreds of institutions. COACHE's multi-dimensional framework covering workload, compensation, climate, tenure clarity, and resources provides the theoretical backbone.</p>

    <p>Additional sources include ModernThink's "Great Colleges to Work For" survey, which emphasizes overall satisfaction and work-life balance measures that predict retention. The Association of American Universities (AAU) Campus Climate Survey informed belonging and inclusion items, particularly important given national attention to faculty diversity and equity. Psychological safety questions adapted Edmondson's organizational behavior research, recognizing that voice and safety drive innovation and honest institutional improvement.</p>

    <p>Literature review revealed several critical factors predicting faculty satisfaction and retention: compensation competitiveness, workload manageability, tenure process clarity and fairness, work-life balance, sense of belonging, research support, teaching resources, and quality of departmental leadership. Studies consistently show that underrepresented faculty (women, faculty of color) experience lower satisfaction, greater service burden, and reduced belonging, making demographic intersectional analysis essential.</p>

    <p>Original contributions include questions addressing contemporary concerns: administrative burden (frequently cited in Chronicle of Higher Education surveys), collaboration opportunities (increasingly important for interdisciplinary research), and specific teaching resource needs (moving beyond general satisfaction to actionable specifics). The survey balances brevity (10-12 minutes, ~30 questions) with comprehensiveness, following survey design principles that response rates decline significantly beyond 15 minutes. Strategic use of display logic (e.g., showing non-tenure track questions only to relevant respondents) reduces burden while maintaining depth.</p>
</div>

<!-- ANALYTICAL OPPORTUNITIES -->
<div class="section-break">
    <h2>ANALYTICAL OPPORTUNITIES</h2>

    <h3>Description of Potential Analytical Opportunities</h3>

    <p>This survey enables sophisticated analysis addressing the Deans' strategic goals around faculty attraction and retention. The combination of satisfaction outcomes, demographic variables, and experience predictors supports multiple analytical approaches that generate actionable insights.</p>

    <p><strong>Comparative analysis</strong> across colleges/schools will identify which units have the strongest and weakest faculty experience, enabling targeted interventions and best practice sharing. For example, if one college demonstrates significantly higher satisfaction and retention, investigating their practices (leadership approach, workload distribution, resource allocation) could inform other units.</p>

    <p><strong>Regression and correlation analysis</strong> can identify which factors most strongly predict overall satisfaction and retention risk. This prioritizes where the institution should invest limited resources—if research funding emerges as the top predictor while classroom facilities show weak association, focus investment accordingly. Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS from Q9) correlates with actual turnover and can benchmark against national norms.</p>

    <p><strong>Equity and inclusion analysis</strong> through demographic cross-tabulations reveals potential disparities. Do women report lower belonging than men? Do faculty of color experience less psychological safety? Does service burden fall disproportionately on underrepresented faculty? Such gaps identify DEI challenges requiring intervention. Intersectional analysis (e.g., women of color in STEM) may reveal compounded disadvantages.</p>

    <p><strong>Segmentation analysis</strong> by career stage, appointment type, and discipline reveals different needs. Junior tenure-track faculty may need mentorship while senior faculty need research support; lecturers may prioritize teaching resources while research faculty focus on funding. Discipline differences (STEM vs. humanities) may require tailored approaches.</p>

    <p><strong>Qualitative analysis</strong> of open-ended responses provides context and specificity. Text analysis can identify common themes, while representative quotes humanize quantitative findings for leadership presentations. Triangulating quantitative patterns with qualitative examples creates compelling narratives for action.</p>

    <p><strong>Longitudinal tracking</strong> (if repeated annually) monitors progress, assesses intervention effectiveness, and identifies emerging issues. Benchmarking against COACHE or peer institution data contextualizes Notre Dame's performance.</p>

        <h3>Interactive Dashboard Demonstration</h3>
        <p>To demonstrate the analytical capabilities of this survey instrument and provide tangible examples of how survey results would be visualized for the Deans, an interactive web-based dashboard was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <p><strong>The dashboard creation process included:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Synthetic Data Generation:</strong> Python was used to generate realistic simulated faculty survey response data (487 responses) with appropriate statistical distributions, correlations between related variables, and demographic patterns consistent with typical university faculty populations.</li>
            <li><strong>Web-Based Visualization Platform:</strong> An interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard was developed using Chart.js and D3.js libraries to create professional, accessible data visualizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Sample Visualizations:</strong> The dashboard presents 8 key analyses (listed below) demonstrating how survey results translate into actionable insights for university leadership.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This interactive demonstration allows stakeholders to explore the data dynamically, filter by demographics, and understand the types of insights the survey would generate. The dashboard serves as both a proof-of-concept and a template for actual survey results visualization.</p>

        <p><strong>Survey Instrument Access:</strong></p>
        <p>The complete Faculty Experience Survey has been implemented in Qualtrics and is available at:<br>

        <div class="analysis-title">ANALYSIS 5: WEEKLY WORK HOURS BY DISCIPLINE</div>

        <p><strong>Method:</strong> Cross-tabulation of Q14 (weekly work hours) by Q5 (discipline), with dual-axis visualization showing both average hours and percentage working 70+ hours</p>

        <p><strong>Insight for Deans:</strong> Quantifies workload disparities across disciplines. STEM faculty typically work longer hours due to lab obligations. Excessive hours (70+) indicate burnout risk regardless of discipline.</p>

        <p><strong>Visualization:</strong> Dual-axis chart with bars showing average hours and line showing percentage in extreme workload category</p>

        <p><strong>Actionable Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disciplines averaging >60 hours: Audit workload expectations, teaching loads, and service requirements</li>
            <li>High percentage working 70+ hours: Implement workload reduction strategies, hiring additional faculty, or rebalancing responsibilities</li>
            <li>Correlate with satisfaction and retention risk to identify tipping point where hours become unsustainable</li>

        <div class="analysis-title">ANALYSIS 6: TENURE PROCESS - CLARITY VS. FAIRNESS SCATTER PLOT</div>

        <p><strong>Method:</strong> Two-dimensional scatter plot mapping Q23 (tenure clarity) against Q24 (tenure fairness) at the college level, with quadrant analysis</p>

        <p><strong>Insight for Deans:</strong> Reveals which colleges have clear AND fair tenure processes (upper right quadrant = ideal) versus unclear, unfair, or mixed situations. Clarity without fairness suggests transparent but biased processes; fairness without clarity suggests good intentions but poor communication.</p>

        <p><strong>Visualization:</strong> Scatter plot with four quadrants defined by university mean scores, with college labels</p>

        <p><strong>Actionable Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lower-left quadrant (low clarity, low fairness): Comprehensive tenure process review required, including criteria documentation, committee training, and transparency improvements</li>
            <li>Upper-left quadrant (fair but unclear): Focus on communication, mentoring, and documentation of expectations</li>
            <li>Lower-right quadrant (clear but unfair): Address bias in evaluation through committee diversity and bias training</li>

        <p><strong>Method:</strong> Cross-tabulation of Q27 (sense of belonging) by Q6 (gender) and Q7 (race/ethnicity) to reveal intersectional experiences, visualized as heatmap</p>

        <p><strong>Insight for Deans:</strong> Belonging gaps often compound at intersections (e.g., women of color experience lower belonging than white women OR men of color alone). Intersectional analysis reveals which faculty populations face the greatest inclusion challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>Visualization:</strong> Heatmap with gender on one axis, race/ethnicity on the other, and color intensity representing belonging scores</p>

        <p><strong>Actionable Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Groups scoring <3.0: Require targeted inclusion interventions such as affinity groups, mentoring circles, or climate initiatives</li>
            <li>Examine whether specific colleges or departments drive disparities through three-way cross-tabulation</li>
            <li>Create accountability metrics for improving belonging among most disadvantaged groups</li>

<!-- AI USAGE DISCLOSURE -->
<div class="section-break">
    <h2>AI USAGE DISCLOSURE</h2>

    <h3>Tools and Techniques Employed</h3>

    <p>In accordance with the assessment guidelines, this disclosure documents the use of artificial intelligence tools throughout the completion of this exercise.</p>

    <p><strong>AI Tool Used:</strong> Claude AI (Anthropic - Claude Sonnet 4.5 model)</p>

    <h3>Specific AI Applications</h3>

    <h4>1. Survey Design and Question Development</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>AI was used for brainstorming initial question phrasing and response option structures</li>
        <li>Suggestions for adapting validated survey items from COACHE, ModernThink, and AAU surveys to Notre Dame's institutional context</li>
        <li>Recommendations for display logic implementation to reduce respondent burden</li>
        <li>All final survey design decisions, question selection, and methodological choices were made through human judgment based on institutional research best practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Simulated Survey Data Generation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>AI generated realistic simulated faculty survey response data (487 responses) for demonstration purposes</li>
        <li>Data generation included appropriate statistical distributions, correlations between related variables, and demographic patterns consistent with typical university faculty populations</li>
        <li>This simulated dataset enabled creation of the interactive dashboard demonstrating analytical capabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Interactive Dashboard Development</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The web-based interactive dashboard was coded primarily by me using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</li>
        <li>AI was used as a support tool for debugging, syntax checking, and troubleshooting technical issues</li>
        <li>Implementation utilized Chart.js library for standard visualizations and D3.js for advanced custom charts</li>
        <li>All dashboard design decisions (color schemes, chart types, layout, accessibility features) were human-directed based on data visualization best practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Documentation and Report Structuring</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>AI assisted in organizing the report structure and formatting consistency</li>
        <li>Helped refine technical writing for clarity and professional presentation</li>
        <li>Provided suggestions for explaining analytical methodologies to non-technical audiences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Human Decision-Making Framework</h3>

    <p>All substantive intellectual work remained human-directed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selection of which validated instruments (COACHE, ModernThink, AAU) to draw upon was based on human expertise in institutional research methodologies</li>
        <li>Determination of which topics to prioritize (satisfaction, retention, workload, belonging, etc.) aligned with the Deans' stated strategic goals</li>
        <li>Analytical framework design reflecting understanding of higher education research, equity analysis requirements, and actionable insight generation</li>
        <li>Assessment of which demographic stratification variables enable meaningful equity analysis while protecting respondent confidentiality</li>
        <li>Judgment regarding survey length, question ordering, and respondent burden considerations</li>
        <li>Interpretation of how survey results would translate into actionable recommendations for Deans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rationale for AI Use</h3>

    <p>AI tools were employed to enhance productivity and technical implementation while maintaining human expertise in institutional research methodology, survey psychometrics, and higher education analytics. This approach mirrors real-world institutional research practice, where AI increasingly serves as a productivity multiplier for technical tasks (data generation, coding, formatting) while domain expertise guides strategic decision-making.</p>

    <p>The use of AI for simulated data generation was particularly valuable, enabling creation of a functional interactive dashboard that demonstrates analytical capabilities without access to actual confidential faculty survey data. This approach showcases how survey results would be visualized and interpreted for stakeholder audiences.</p>

    <h3>Limitations and Considerations</h3>

    <p>Simulated data, while statistically realistic, does not reflect actual Notre Dame faculty experiences. Real survey implementation would require:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IRB review and approval for human subjects research</li>
        <li>Pilot testing of survey instrument with small faculty sample</li>
        <li>Validation of psychometric properties (reliability, construct validity)</li>
        <li>Partnership with faculty governance and Deans to ensure buy-in</li>
        <li>Confidentiality protocols and secure data storage</li>
        <li>Professional survey administration platform (Qualtrics, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The analytical framework and dashboard prototype demonstrate methodological competency but would require adaptation based on actual response patterns, sample sizes within demographic subgroups, and institutional priorities.</p>
