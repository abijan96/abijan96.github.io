9. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total feedback comments: 75

Sample feedback:

1. The morning transition times were a little long and then the breakouts had to rush some to get all the content in. Perhaps rethinking the flow and timing. Although I do appreciate that it's not all sessions back to back because that is also a lot in a day. 

2. This was a great experience. Honestly our own ND staff provided the best insight.

3. Anything relating to IT seems to need a little longer in training. I also think there were too many breaks (or too long)

4. The schedule had far too much down time. I recognize the importance of networking, but unfortunately, the extra time did not feel intentional or like it was intended for networking. 
The morning keynote speaker was disjointed, hard to follow, and seemed aimed at corporations rather than our work lives. 
The AI fireside chat completely ignored and refused to engage with the question surrounding the ethics of AI. While the speaker said he was interested in hosting those conversations and creating a space for those conversations, he actively shut down the question and refused to hold a space for that conversation.  

5. The breakouts didn’t have enough time or maybe I enjoyed them too much I wanted them to go on. Content was fantastic.  This day flew by.  Great choices for breakouts

6. I just attended the session, and honestly, I left feeling disappointed by the speaker’s approach. Empathy at work isn’t just a nice idea-it’s an essential part of creating a healthy, human workplace. I don’t want my workplace to feel like just a place to get things done; I want it to be a space where people can show up as who they really are, emotions and all. Lately, I’ve realized more than ever how important it is to bring empathy, authenticity, and understanding into what we do every day.

7. Great to interact with colleagues inside and outside my division. Could have had more options for breakfast (aware of budget restraints at this time). Lunch was great. 
A lot of content that were a snapshot to trainings or tools available 

8. I appreciated having a practical class (spreadsheet 101) however I would love more advanced options in the future (201? 301?) with a longer time window. I also loved talking about project management but the session was an intro session for those exploring new tools. I’d love a session to dive deeper into a more advanced conversation on that topic. Advanced skill building in person would be such a gift. 

9. N/a

10. There was a lot of down time and the sessions felt rushed so I wish there would be more time for sessions and less down time


Future content suggestions: 51

Sample suggestions:

1. Leadership, preparing to be people managers, how to utilize and respect your Human Resources 

2. The leadershiptap presentation was great, more content from them 

3. More practical work management advice and more self care ideas. 

4. Morning ice breaker maybe

5. Self care

6. I would like to see more time given to the breakout sessions so we can get more than just a basic overview of things. I would also like to see more flexibility in the schedule, so if a speaker ends a half hour early, we aren’t all sitting around waiting for the next event. 

7. how to work with faculty who have no management training but are elevated to a management position. Ask networking Groups on campus to have literature available like Thrive. Maybe tables during lunch to discuss

8. N/a

9. More practical conversation around AI implementation 

10. I really appreciate hearing from panels of experts across campus on different topics! I mentioned slightly above, but I'd love to have a chance to get the "201" sessions of topics year to year (like different tracks) to build on what is covered the previous year. Overall, I love these days and am so grateful to all those who helped organize, plan, and present!
