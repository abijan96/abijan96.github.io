Having documented policies and practices in place and widely distributed to people leaders is preferred, so we can reference materials on a regular basis. Also, this type of training might be helpful for those who are new to leadership - or new to ND - but not necessarily helpful for seasoned leaders. Finally, as one of the Zoom participants, the room is not conducive to hybrid learning. Audio was an ongoing struggle throughout the session, the breakout rooms were organized late, and other issues. I would also recommend avoiding spots on campus that are too far to walk to quickly, as many of us have other meetings scheduled immediately before or after these sessions - plus it was held during lunch hour, meaning we would need to heat and carry our food, beverages, and work materials all of the way over... not ideal.

I would have preferred if we consolidated the first 2 hours into 30 min and then explored tools and how to break through what gets in the way in our own fixing and receiving candor.
