## TL;DR
A poetic journey through my life - from Tokyo to Delhi to Notre Dame, weaving together data analytics, anime, culinary adventures, and football fandom into a narrative of who I am today.

## Introduction

Hello, world!

As a data analyst, I'm used to expressing myself through numbers, dashboards, and SQL queries. But today, I want to try something different. This first post is a departure from the technical - it's a poem that tells my story.

## A Journey in Verse

> *From Tokyo streets where cherry blossoms bloom,*
> *To Delhi's chaos, my second home,*
> *Eight years of wonder shaped my view,*
> *Two worlds collided, something new.*
>
> *With data streams and SQL queries deep,*
> *I chart the patterns others don't see,*
> *From logistics hubs to research halls,*
> *Each number tells a story, stands tall.*
>
> *In anime worlds I find my peace,*
> *Where heroes rise and conflicts cease,*
> *Chelsea blue runs through my veins,*
> *Through joy and heartbreak, passion remains.*
>
> *With spatula in hand and spices near,*
> *I travel the world, cuisine by cuisine,*
> *From ramen bowls to Indian curry,*
> *Each dish a story, never in a hurry.*
>
> *From civil plans to business mind,*
> *At Manipal, two worlds combined,*
> *Now Notre Dame shapes what's ahead,*
> *Analytics and insights, where I'm led.*
>
> *A Delhi boy with global dreams,*
> *Life's more than just what it seems,*
> *From Japan's shores to America's land,*
> *I analyze, I cook, I stand.*

## What This Blog Will Be

This space will be a mix of:

- **Culinary adventures**: My experiments in the kitchen and discoveries from around the world
- **Random musings**: Everything from anime recommendations to Chelsea FC analysis

## Key Takeaways

- I'm a data analyst with a multicultural background
- I believe in bringing creativity to technical work
- This blog will blend the analytical with the personal
- Every dataset has a story, and every story has data

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for upcoming posts on:
- Time series forecasting techniques I've learned at Notre Dame

- My journey learning different cuisines through a data-driven approach

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading this unconventional first post. In a world of numbers and logic, sometimes we need poetry to remind us of the human element behind every data point.

Whether you're here for the technical content or the personal stories (or both), I'm glad you're here.

Let's begin this journey together.
