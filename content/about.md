## Professional Journey

Business analytics and BI professional experienced in research administration, logistics, retail/sports merchandising, enterprise tech, and real estate/customer experience.

Focused on SQL-driven pipelines, dashboarding (Tableau/Power BI), and time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) that improve decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Beyond the Data

While numbers and dashboards define my professional life, there's more to my story. I spent my formative years in Japan until age 8, an experience that shaped my appreciation for different cultures and perspectives. As a proud Delhi boy at heart, I carry the vibrant energy of India's capital wherever I go.

My passions extend far beyond analytics:

- **Anime Enthusiast**: From the philosophical depths of cyberpunk narratives to the emotional journeys of character-driven stories, anime has been a constant companion.

- **Culinary Explorer**: I don't just cook—I explore the entire culinary world. Understanding the history, techniques, and cultural significance behind each cuisine is my way of traveling through flavors and traditions.

- **Chelsea FC Supporter**: Through victories and defeats, the Blues have taught me resilience and the importance of strategic thinking—lessons that translate surprisingly well to data analytics.
